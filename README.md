# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-

This Repo contains Code Book file that describes the data sets related to this project and run_analysis.R file.
To run the file the working directory in R Studio should be set to the directory containing "UCI HRA Dataset" folder.
Then Opening and Sourcing run_analysis.R should do the trick.

The data sets from UCI HRA Dataset directory will be loaded, all required data transformation/computation performed and the resulting tidy data set will be saved.
Computational details can be found in  run_analysis.R
