# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-

This Repo contains Code Book file that describes the data sets related to this project and run_analysis.R  file.
To run the file the working directory in R Studio should be set to the directory containing "UCI HAR Dataset" folder:
Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory...
After setting the working directory run_analysis.R file should be open: File -> Open File.. 
and sourced: Source

The work is done!
The data sets from UCI HAR Dataset directory will be loaded, all required data transformation/computation performed and the resulting tidy data set will be saved in txt format.

Details of transformation/computation can be found in  run_analysis.R file.
