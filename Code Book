The data set required in step 4 of the project description consists of 10299 observations of 68 variables.
The last two variables are subject (there were 30 people participating in the study) and activity. Each of 30 subjects was performing 6 
types of activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
The first 66 variables are calculated based on the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals (more detailed information regarding 
the calculation can be found in the features_info.txt file UCI HAR Dataset directory). 
The signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

(These are the original variables)

tBodyAcc-XYZ            tBodyAccMag             fBodyAcc-XYZ          fBodyGyroMag
tGravityAcc-XYZ         tGravityAccMag          fBodyAccJerk-XYZ      fBodyGyroJerkMag
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ        tBodyAccJerkMag         fBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ           tBodyGyroMag            fBodyAccMag
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ       tBodyGyroJerkMag        fBodyAccJerkMag

This gives us 33 variables. Then this set was estimated with mean() and std() functions. That is 66 variables in all.
One of the task in the project was to change the above variables' names to descriptive and formatted ones. 
The resulting set of variables is the following:

meanoftimebodyaccelerationbyx                             
meanoftimebodyaccelerationbyy                  
meanoftimebodyaccelerationbyz           

Then in the same way,

time variables:                                               frequency variables:

meanoftimegravityaccelerationby(x/y/z)                        meanoffrequencybodyaccelerationby(x/y/z)
meanoftimebodyaccelerationjerkby(x/y/z)                       meanoffrequencybodyaccelerationjerkby(x/y/z)
meanoftimebodygyroscopeby(x/y/z)                              meanoffrequencybodygyroscopeby(x/y/z)
meanoftimebodygyroscopejerkby(x/y/z)                          meanoffrequencybodyaccelerationmagnitude
meanoftimebodyaccelerationmagnitude                           meanoffrequencybodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude
meanoftimebodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude                       meanoffrequencybodygyroscopemagnitude
meanoftimebodygyroscopemagnitude                              meanoffrequencybodygyroscopejerkmagnitude
meanoftimebodygyroscopejerkmagnitude

And with std() function,

time variables:                                               freqyency variables:

stdoftimebodyaccelerationby(x/y/z)                            stdoffrequencybodyaccelerationby(x/y/z)
stdoftimegravityaccelerationby(x/y/z)                         stdoffrequencybodyaccelerationjerkby(x/y/z)
stdoftimebodyaccelerationjerkby(x/y/z)                        stdoffrequencybodygyroscopeby(x/y/z)
stdoftimebodygyroscopeby(x/y/z)                               stdoffrequencybodyaccelerationmagnitude
stdoftimebodygyroscopejerkby(x/y/z)                           stdoffrequencybodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude
stdoftimebodyaccelerationmagnitude                            stdoffrequencybodygyroscopemagnitude
stdoftimebodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude                        stdoffrequencybodygyroscopejerkmagnitude
stdoftimebodygyroscopemagnitude                              
stdoftimebodygyroscopejerkmagnitude

In the resulting tidy data set there are 180 (30 subjects each performing 6 activities) observations of 68 (described above) variables, 
that were averaged by subject and activity.
